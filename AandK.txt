Andrew and Kara

The gentle breeze on the lake toyed with the moonlight there, splintering the image into a thousand points of light across the water. The water lapping softly against the boat as Andrew readied it rang in his ears as he looked up the rise at the nearby houses. He still wasn't sure this was a good idea, but Kara wanted the late night row out under the stars, and he was certainly willing to risk it for her smile.
Kara, for her part, was excitedly breathing in the cool air to help calm herself. She gently dropped her shoes into the rowboat as she helped place the oars and untie the lines. She smiled at him again, loving the goofy grin he got every time she did. He was absolutely smitten with her, and she couldn't enjoy the attention more. He was a handsome boy, tall and blonde, and always well dressed. Tonight, his crisp polo was light blue, and accentuated the color of her dress perfectly. She admired that about him, that he was always thinking about ways to show her off. He said he'd learned it dancing, and she didn't doubt it.
